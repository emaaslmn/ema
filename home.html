                        My full name is Emalen A. Solomon. You can call me Emalen but I prefer to be called "EMA". My middle name is "Alcantara".<br>
                        I was born on March 29, 2002. That makes me 22 years old, this year!<br>
                        Currently, I am studying at St. Louis College of Valenzuela taking up Bachelor of Science in Accounting Information System.
                        After I graduate, I plan to take units for Bachelor of Science in Accountancy, for me to be eligible to take CPALE. 
                        Soon I will be a Certified Public Accountant and have master's degree on Business Administration. 
                        I will be called "Ms. Emalen A. Solomon, CPA, MBA". That's the dream!

                         I'm Ema, your Aries. Energetic and adventurous, 
                         I always seek new experiences and challenges. 
                         One day, I stumbled upon a mysterious old book that transported me to a different realm. 
                         As I navigated through this fantastical world, I encountered magical creatures and faced daunting obstacles. 
                         Along the way, I discovered hidden powers within myself that helped me overcome each trial.
                          With courage and determination, I embarked on a quest to find my way back home. 
                          As I journeyed through the enchanting landscapes and faced formidable foes, 
                          I learned valuable lessons about resilience and self-discovery. In the end,
                          I emerged stronger and wiser, forever changed by the extraordinary adventure that shaped me into the fearless warrior I am today.
